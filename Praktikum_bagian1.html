    <b>Web development</b> refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of websites.
    It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. 
    Web development is typically broken down into 3 core areas: <i>Frontend, Backend, Full Stack Development.</i>

    <ol type="A">
        <li><b>Frontend Development</b></li>
        <p>The Face of the Web. The part of a website where the user interacts directly is termed as front end.
        This involves designing the structure, layout, and behavior of the website. 
        It is also referred to as the ‘<i>client side</i>’ of the application.</p>
        <ul>
            <b>Frontend Technologies</b>
            <ul type="disc"> 
                <li>HTML</li>
                <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design the front end p
                ortion of web pages using markup language. It acts as a skeleton for a website 
                since it is used to make the structure of a website.</p>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process 
                of making web pages presentable. It is used to style our website.</p>
                <li>Java Script</li>
                <p>JavaScript is a scripting language used to provide a dynamic behavior to our website.</p>
                <li>Boot Strap</li>
                <p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications. 
                It is the most popular CSS framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites.</p>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li><b>Backend Development</b></li>
        <p>The Backbone of the Web. Backend is the server side of a website. It is part of the website that users cannot see and interact with. 
        It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. It is used to store and arrange data.</p>
        <ul>
            <b>Server-side Programming Languages and Frameworks</b>
            <ol>
                <li>PHP</li>
                <p>PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development.</p>
                <li>Java</li>
                <p>Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages. It is highly scalable.</p>
                <li>Python</li>
                <p>Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.</p>
                <li>Node.js</li>
                <p>Node.js is an open source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser.</p>
            </ol>
        </ul>

        <li><b>Database</b></li>
        <p>
            In web technology, a database is a structured collection of data that is stored electronically and accessed via a web application. It serves as the backend component where data is stored, 
            managed, and retrieved. Databases can be relational (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) using structured tables and SQL for queries, 
            or non-relational (like MongoDB, CouchDB) which store data in flexible, document-oriented formats. 
            <pre>They enable web applications to handle dynamic content, user data, transactions, <br>and more by providing efficient storage, retrieval, </br>and manipulation capabilities. Database management systems (DBMS) are used to interact with the database, ensuring data integrity, security, and performance.
            </pre>
        </p>

        <dl> 
            <dt><b>Relation Database</b></dt>
            <dd>A relational database stores data in tables, similar to a spreadsheet, where each table has rows and columns. 
                The rows hold individual records, and the columns define the data attributes. Tables can be linked to each other through special keys, allowing related data to be connected.
            </dd>
            <dt><b>Non SQL Database</b></dt>
            <dd>
                A NoSQL database stores data in a flexible, non-tabular format, unlike traditional relational databases. 
                Instead of using tables with rows and columns, NoSQL databases might use documents, key-value pairs, wide-columns, or graphs to store data.
